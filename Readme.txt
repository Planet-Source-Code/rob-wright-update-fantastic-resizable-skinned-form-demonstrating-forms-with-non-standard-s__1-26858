Thanks for downloading this VB project - I hope
you find it useful.  There are two directories
with two VB projects in.  If you want to see the
capabilities of this project, choose Demo.  If
you've seen them and want a blank canvas to write
your own programs around, choose Blank Canvas.

Currently you can have two methods of resizing:
as the sides are dragged, or on the mouse button
release.  The first is quite flickery due to the
large amount of code required to make the window.
Choose for yourself which one you want.

I really would appreciate comments, suggestions,
*constructive* criticism (!) and anything else you'd
like to say.  So please, if there's something on your
mind (preferably not that you're goldfish has just
died or something like that) just mail me at
rob@xenonic.com and I'll try and get back to you
soon.
