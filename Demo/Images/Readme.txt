******************************************************
* COLOUR SCHEMES FOR THE RESIZABLE WINDOW VB PROJECT *
******************************************************

~ SPECIAL THANKS GOES TO KARL BAWIEDEMANN FOR HIS HELP
  IN THE MAXIMIZE / RESTORE BUTTONS

The images required are the five GIF images in this
directory:

~ imgWindowBottom.gif
~ imgWindowBottomLeft.gif
~ imgWindowBottomRight.gif
~ imgWindowLeft.gif
~ imgWindowRight.gif

And then the six GIF images in either one of the eight
colour scheme directories (Blue, Green, Purple, Red):

~ imgTitleClose.gif
~ imgTitleHelp.gif
~ imgTitleLeft.gif
~ imgTitleMain.gif
~ imgTitleMinimize.gif
~ imgTitleMaximize.gif
~ imgTitleRestore.gif
~ imgTitleRight.gif

Also included is the Macromedia Fireworks PNG file from
which I exported the GIF files.  To change a colour scheme
(the default in the VB Project is Blue), simply load each
of the six images into a graphics editor, copy the image
and paste it as the Image property in the corresponding
image.
